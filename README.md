# YouTubeTimeShare 
## v1.0.001 - by genBTC 
### YouTubeTimeShare Chrome Extension: Creates custom URLs for Youtube videos with starting AND ending times (to make clips).

View "YouTubeTimeShare-image1.png" to see what the program looks like.
View "Permissions.png" for proof of the normal permissions.

Download "YouTubeTimeShare.crx" and drag it into the Chrome Extensions Manager window to add it. DONE!
or 
Just download this whole github as a zip file, extract it to its own dir, and say "Load Unpacked Extension" from the Extension Manager.
(However that will give you an annoying warning message everytime you load up, and the CRX is safe)
